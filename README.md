A Capstone Project entitled Locator for Recyclable Materials shops with Best Price Recommendation


This is my Capstone project that i am working during my 4th year college as a final requirement for my graduation.

This is a mobile based application that focuses to give a best price recommendation on selling the reusable materials to a junkshop.


The study is about to determine the locations of the junkshops and allows the user to do the following:

1. to select an item to be sold and it would recommend the highest buying price.
2. to select an item to be bought and it would recommend the lowest selling price.
3. provide a route from the user's location to the selected junkshop.
4. to select a shop and view its details.


Junkers side (Junkshop Owners)

1. to add an item name, price, unit or description.
2. to modify the item name, price, unit or description.
3. to modify the information about the shop.

Note! The Junkshops located are only limited within the area of Ozamiz City, Misamis Occidental Philippines.
